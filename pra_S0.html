## Course Objectives

To improve understanding and application of remote sensing concepts, methods, and techniques and exploit their potential for producing thematic information and  supporting *sustainable development* applications. 

Class discussions, reading &amp; practical assignments, and class lectures enable students to **apply/adapt/create  image processing and analysis workflows** to understand 
and/or address a *sustainable development goal*.

# Technical Reports
========================================================

Write  **reproducible**  image processing & analysis reports. 

Publish online every report (e.g. [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/), Google Sites, [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

A technical report should be:
- clear, concise, and complete, with assumptions plainly identified and data presented,
- with precise logic, with relevance to practices described, and 
- with actual accomplishments of the work clearly stated and honestly appraised.      
      
A report can be truly reproducible when:
- All methods are fully reported.
- All data and files used for the analysis are (publicly) available.
- The process of processing  and analyzing raw data is detailed reported and preserved.
