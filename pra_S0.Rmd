## Course Objectives

To improve understanding of remote sensing concepts, methods, and techniques and create awareness of their advantages & limitations for supporting *sustainable development* applications. 

Class discussions, reading & practical assignments, and class lectures enable students to develop remote sensing projects to understand and/or address a *sustainable development goal*.

# Course Overview

---
# How this class will work
========================================================
- No programming knowledge assumed

- A previous course on remote sensing basics is necessary

- Class attendance is mandatory 
  - *Virtual* stage: from 28.08 to 31.09
  - *Presencial* stage: from 01.10 to 13.12

- Class will be _very_ cumulative

---

# Mechanics
========================================================
- A  weekly lecture: 
  - First session: concepts, methods, examples
  - Second session:  practical labs
  
- Two exams (50%)

- Two practical assignments (50%):
  - A report on image analysis using R   (25%)
  - A report on image analysis using GEE (25%)
    
- To pass the class,  the minimum score is 3.0/5.0
    
---

# Mechanics   
========================================================
  
- Exams  
  - There will be <b>2</b> exams:    
  - First Exam __on Noviembre 5 at 2:00 pm__
  - Second Exam __on Diciembre 7  at 2:00 pm__

# Report 1
========================================================

Write a **reproducible** __RMarkdown__ report to understand and/or address any SDG in **your study area**. Publish it on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)

A report can be truly reproducible when:

- All methods are fully reported.
- All data and files used for the analysis are (publicly) available.
- The process of analyzing raw data is well reported and preserved.

# Report 2
========================================================

Write a **reproducible** GEE_based report to understand and/or address any SDG in **your study area**. Publish it online (Google sites?)

Make sure that your report should be truly reproducible.
